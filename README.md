Hey there! I am an undergrad from the D.C. area interested in archives, storytelling, and the digital humanities.   

These days I mostly read and write in my spare time. But if I'm coding outside of work hours, I'll be working on a [data visualization about the 1818 and 1831 versions of *Frankenstein*](https://github.com/caroldinh/frankenstein-diff).

If you want to say hi, you can reach me at `ctdinh443[at]gmail[dot]com`!
